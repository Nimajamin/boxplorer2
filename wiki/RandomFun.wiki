Conway's Game of Life.

Boxplorer2 can keep a backbuffer containing the previous frame. When feeding that as input to the next frame, it is straightforward to implement Conway's Game of Life in a pixel shader, as shown by syntopia in a Fragmentarium example shader.
Add loading interesting starting positions and it gets entertaining.

First edit
 `cfgs/syntopia/life/default.cfg`
to match your fullscreen resolution, if you do not have a snazzy 2560x1600 screen. (TODO: detect rez).

Then, for instance, try
 `./boxplorer cfgs/syntopia/life/ --lifeform=gliderproducingswitchengine_106.lif`
and watch the mayhem unfold when the action wraps around the screen.


If you start that shader without a lifeform, you'll get syntopia's Ring o'Fire generating random action. Try swirling it around.
